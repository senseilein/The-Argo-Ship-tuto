Tuto example: https://6cbw7.csb.app/

**My first attempt**: https://jddw2.csb.app/index.html

**Features that needed to be included in the website:**

    * Header (displaying the Argo logo, provided below the wireframes*)
    * Navigation bar (including links to all HTML pages)
    * Home page (including a welcome section using a CSS background-image, and a section displaying the history of the ship)
    * Our Argo Heroes page (displaying their image, name, and motto)
    * Inventory page (including an HTML inventory table)
    * A contact page with a form (to contact the coast guard from anywhere on the ship)
    * Optional: popup message upon submission of the form (JavaScript)
    * Optional: results of last javelin throw competition
    * The Argo logo (feel free to use your own though)

1. Started with a basic HTML page
2. Added a CSS style sheet
3. Created several HTML pages and added a navigation menu to allow users to navigate to each page of the site
4. Used JavaScript to program the behavior of the contact form
